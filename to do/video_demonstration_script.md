# Video Demonstration Script
## Agentic AI Trend Analysis System - Pulsegen Technologies

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes  
**Audience:** Technical stakeholders and product teams

---

## üé¨ INTRODUCTION (15 seconds)

**[Screen: Project title and overview]**

> "Hi! I'm demonstrating the Agentic AI Trend Analysis System I built for Pulsegen Technologies. This system automatically analyzes Google Play Store reviews for Swiggy using advanced multi-agent AI to detect trending topics with high recall and intelligent consolidation."

---

## üèóÔ∏è SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (20 seconds)

**[Screen: Show project structure and key files]**

> "The system uses a multi-agent architecture with four specialized AI agents:
> - Discovery Agent for topic detection using rule-based and clustering methods
> - Classification Agent for high-recall review categorization  
> - Consolidation Agent with 85% similarity threshold for merging similar topics
> - Quality Assessment Agent for validating topic quality"

## üöÄ LIVE DEMONSTRATION (60 seconds)

**[Screen: Terminal showing pipeline execution]**

> "Let me run the complete demo. I'll execute our agentic pipeline processing 15 days of Swiggy reviews from June 2024."

**[Type command:]** `python main_pipeline_agentic.py --mode demo`

**[While system runs, explain:]**

> "Watch as the system:
> 1. Simulates daily review collection using Google Play Store scraper
> 2. Applies multi-agent topic detection - you can see it discovering both seed topics like 'delivery_delay' and emerging topics
> 3. Uses advanced consolidation to merge similar topics like 'delivery guy was rude' and 'delivery partner behaved badly' into 'delivery_partner_behavior'
> 4. Generates comprehensive trend analysis with T-30 to T window as required"

---

## üìä RESULTS ANALYSIS (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Show generated HTML report]**

> "Here's the final trend report showing exactly what was requested:
> - Rows are topics like delivery issues, food quality, app performance
> - Columns are dates from June 1st to 15th
> - Cells show frequency counts per topic per day
> 
> The system detected trending topics like 'food_quality' and emerging issues, providing product teams with actionable insights."
